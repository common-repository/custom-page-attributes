Customize the parent page dropdown in the page attributes meta box to show only top-level ones with no parent.

== Description ==

This plugin customizes the parent page dropdown in the page attributes meta box, limiting it to top-level pages with no parent.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `custom-page-attributes` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the "Custom Page Attributes" plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Screenshots ==

1. If your website contains a large number of pages, you may feel lost and overwhelmed while attempting to assign each page a parent page. For instance, when assigning a page for the city of "Abbeville" to the parent page of the state "Alabama," you might encounter difficulty due to the extensive list of pages already assigned, such as Alabaster, Alexander City, and others, resulting in endless scrolling.
2. After activating the plugin, you'll be able to streamline the pages displayed in the page attributes box to show only the top-level pages. Allowing you to add this page under Alabama, or Alaska or any other state's page. This feature not only saves you time but also helps preserve your mouse wheel lifespan! ðŸ˜„.
